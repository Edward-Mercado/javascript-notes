JAVASCRIPT NOTES

declaring variables;

using "let" -> allows the variable to change
let x = 5;

using const -> cannot be redefined
const x = 80;

booleans = t/f
let g = true

int = integer
let g = 1

float = non whole numbers
let g = 1.2

string = words
let g = "hi"

null = nothing (absence of value, similar to NoneType)
let g = null;

undefined = nothing, but bad
let g;

scope = local vs global for the function
is it defined with the function or globally
if its local within a function it cannot be accessed outside of it
(would return as undefined)

fstrings
{`Hello ${name}`}

functions ---------------------------
input -> output

function add(x, y) {
    return(x+y);
}

return to set the output, you can also set a variable to this output
or you can just make it do random stuff
